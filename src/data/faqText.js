  text: "Children 5th grade and above may be dropped off at your own risk.  We will do everything we can to make sure they are safe and behave according to our store rules/policies.  If your child struggles to follow the rules, we reserve the right to terminate their time without refund and ban them from future visits.  You know your child better than anyone else.  If they struggle with following rules, you will probably want to stay close by to avoid any issues."
